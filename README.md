### Requirements

We need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) to install and run scripts.

## Install and run

Run next commands in your terminal:

1. `npm install`: Install dependencies and launch browser with examples. Check http://localhost:8000 for the demo.
2. `npm start`: Launch browser to show the examples. Press `Ctrl + c` to kill the **server** process.

## Editor Notes

I added a boot screen and game screen disambiguation. All game scenes are placed in the `/scenes` folder, which promotes modulation. If you need to edit files outside of the `/src` folder, you'll need to kill and restart any currently running `npm start` induced processes. I've also added some comments in the base code to help new devs figure out where to place things.
